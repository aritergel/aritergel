#  Python Programming Assignment: Football Data Analysis

##  Overview
This project covers football player data collection, analysis, clustering, and transfer value prediction using Python. The data is based on the 2024–2025 English Premier League season.

---

## I.  Data Collection from FBref

- Scraped from https://fbref.com/en/.
- Included players with more than 90 minutes of play.
- Extracted key statistics: Nation, Team, Age, Position, Goals, Assists, xG, xAG, Passing, Defending, etc.
- Missing values marked as "N/a".
- Saved final dataset as `results.csv`.

---

## II. Statistical Analysis

### ✔ Top 3 Players
- Identified top 3 highest & lowest players for each numeric stat.
- Saved to `top_3.txt`.

### ✔ Summary Stats
- Calculated Median, Mean, and Standard Deviation for each attribute:
  - Overall
  - Per team
- Saved to `results2.csv`.

### ✔ Histogram Plots
- Plotted distribution histograms of each stat.
- Saved in `/histograms/` folder.

### ✔ Best Performing Team
- Identified team with highest average for each stat.

## III.  Player Clustering (K-Means + PCA)

- Selected numeric features, scaled data.
- Used elbow method to choose optimal `k` (see `elbow_plot.png`).
- Applied K-Means clustering and PCA for 2D visualization.
- Cluster plot saved as `clusters_pca_2D.png`.

---

## IV.  Transfer Value Estimation

- Assigned mock values to players (>900 minutes played).
- Trained Linear Regression model using selected features (goals, assists, xG, etc.).
- Evaluated using RMSE.
- Saved results to `player_transfer_values.csv`.

##  Libraries Used

- `pandas` – data manipulation  
- `numpy` – numeric processing  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization  
- `scikit-learn` – machine learning  
- `requests`, `beautifulsoup4` – web scraping  
- `fpdf` – PDF generation

---

##  Outcome

This project showcases full-cycle data analysis:
- Web scraping
- Data wrangling
- Visualization
- Clustering
- Predictive modeling

It can be extended to real transfer data and more advanced ML models for improved accuracy.
